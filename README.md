___Project Title: Hybrid Machine Learning Model for Cancer Diagnosis___

__Overview:__

This project aims to develop a robust hybrid machine learning model for accurate cancer diagnosis. The model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Gradient Boosting to achieve superior performance compared to individual models.

__Dataset:__

Skin Cancer: Malignant vs. Benign dataset

3,600 images (1,800 benign, 1,800 malignant)

80/20 train-test split

__Methodology:__

__Data Preprocessing:__

Resizing images to 224x224 pixels

Normalizing pixel values to 0-1 range

Batching images for efficient processing

Shuffling data for unbiased training

__Feature Engineering:__

Extracting relevant features using VGG16

Visualizing features using t-SNE and PCA

__Model Selection and Implementation:__

Hybrid model combining CNN, SVM, and Gradient Boosting

Python and Scikit-Learn for implementation

Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance

__Evaluation:__

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Specificity metrics

Confusion matrices for visualization

__Results:__

The hybrid model achieved an accuracy of 84%, outperforming individual models.

The model demonstrated strong performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and specificity.

The hybrid approach offers a promising avenue for improved cancer diagnosis.

__Future Work:__

Explore larger and more diverse datasets
