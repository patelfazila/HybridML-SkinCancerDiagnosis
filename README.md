**Project Title: Hybrid Machine Learning Model for Cancer Diagnosis
**
**Overview:
**
This project aims to develop a robust hybrid machine learning model for accurate cancer diagnosis. The model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Gradient Boosting to achieve superior performance compared to individual models.

**Dataset:
**
Skin Cancer: Malignant vs. Benign dataset
3,600 images (1,800 benign, 1,800 malignant)
80/20 train-test split

**Methodology:
**
Data Preprocessing:
Resizing images to 224x224 pixels
Normalizing pixel values to 0-1 range
Batching images for efficient processing
Shuffling data for unbiased training
Feature Engineering:
Extracting relevant features using VGG16
Visualizing features using t-SNE and PCA
Model Selection and Implementation:
Hybrid model combining CNN, SVM, and Gradient Boosting
Python and Scikit-Learn for implementation
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
Evaluation:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Specificity metrics
Confusion matrices for visualization

**Results:
**
The hybrid model achieved an accuracy of 84%, outperforming individual models.
The model demonstrated strong performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and specificity.
The hybrid approach offers a promising avenue for improved cancer diagnosis.

**Future Work:
**
Explore larger and more diverse datasets
Incorporate additional data sources (molecular, environmental)
Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning and architecture exploration
Enhance model interpretability
Seamless integration into clinical workflows
